            <p class="p1">
                Neon lights in Hong Kong are vibrant and iconic illuminated signs
                 that adorn the city's streets. 
                 They became popular in the 1950s and 1960s for advertising purposes and are made with glass tubes filled with noble gases. 
                 These colorful signs display the names and logos of businesses and can be found throughout busy commercial areas. While their use has declined in recent years, neon lights remain a significant part of Hong Kong's cultural identity, creating a visually stunning and nostalgic atmosphere in the city.

            <h2 align="center" >History of Neon Lights in Hong Kong </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><u>1960s - Rising Era</u></li>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Neon lights began to gain popularity in Hong Kong during the 1960s. 
                    They started appearing on the streets, primarily used for advertising purposes.
                     Neon signs were relatively simple in design compared to later decades.
                </p>
                <li> <u>1970s - As it peak</u></li>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    The 1970s marked the peak of neon lights in Hong Kong. 
                    During this era, neon signs were prevalent and played a significant role in the city's <mark> advertising </mark> and <mark>commercial </mark> landscape 
                    The streets were adorned with vibrant neon signs of various sizes, shapes, and colors, creating a visually striking and lively atmosphere.
                </p>
                <li><u>1980s - Magic is everywhere</u></li>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    The 1980s saw the continuation of neon lights' dominance in Hong Kong. 
                    The signs became more elaborate and sophisticated in design, incorporating advanced neon bending techniques. 
                    Neon-lit billboards, building facades covered in neon displays, and large neon signs spanning across streets became increasingly popular.
                </p>
                <li><u>1990s - Intersection</u></li>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    In the 1990s, the prevalence of neon lights started to decline. 
                    The rapid urban development and modernization of Hong Kong led to the introduction of newer advertising mediums, such as digital displays and LED technology.
                    These alternatives gradually replaced traditional neon lights.
                </p>
                <li><u>2000s - The end of neon eras</u></li>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Neon lights further diminished in the 2000s. 
                    Stricter regulations on outdoor advertising, including limitations on the size and placement of neon signs, 
                    resulted in a significant reduction in their numbers.
                    Businesses began to opt for more cost-effective and versatile advertising methods.

                As the neon signs began disappearing from Hong Kong's streets, there was a growing appreciation for their cultural and historical significance. Efforts were made to preserve and document these iconic signs. Organizations, artists, and photographers embarked on projects to capture the fading neon signs, recognizing their value as symbols of Hong Kong's identity and heritage. Some neon signs were even relocated to museums or heritage centers to be displayed as artifacts.

                In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in neon signs, driven by nostalgia and a desire to preserve Hong Kong's unique visual culture. While the number of neon signs has significantly decreased, you can still find pockets of the city where these iconic displays continue to shine. Some businesses, particularly those in the entertainment and food industries, have embraced neon signs as a way to create a retro atmosphere and attract customers. Additionally, there has been a rise in neon-inspired art installations and exhibitions that pay homage to Hong Kong's neon heritage.
